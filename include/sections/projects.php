     <p class="msg" data-msg_id="read-only-members">Projects can now have read-only 
         members. Click on the <span class="tinybutton">A</span> or 
         <span class="tinybutton">R</span> next to a project member's name to toggle 
         their access permission. I have not yet thoroughly checked that read-only 
         members cannot make any destructive project changes, so please be careful 
         and only add project members you trust. If you set a project that you own 
         to read-only, you will be able to change this back. If you set a project 
         that you don't own to read-only, you will need to ask the owner to 
         reinstate your permissions.</p>
